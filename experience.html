          It is not the beauty of a building you should look at; it's the
          construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.
          (David Allan Coe).

          Ever since I was a little kid, I've had a passion for creating things
          and seeing my ideas come to life. As I grew older my love for
          technology and building things have led me to the amazing world of web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a web developer not only allows me to learn new things and meet
          new people but gives me the opportunity to create something meaningful
          for myself and possibly millions of other people.
